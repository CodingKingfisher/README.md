# ParrotCode101 #

Hey everyone! I am ParrotCode101; your friendly neighborhood Parrot that loves to code! I mostly code in HTML, CSS, & JS; though I  can code fairly well in Python, Python Turtle, Node.JS, JavaScript, and a bit of Ruby.

I love the colour eco-green. As you might know, Psittaciformes are a large intrest of mine. I really love to play sports like Cricket and Soccer. You can find me on [repl.it](http://repl.it/YashasShah), [GitHub](http://github.com/ParrotCode101), and [Schoology](https://henrico.schoology.com/user/56262070/info).

Some of my favourite hobbies (excluding coding) include:
- [x] Biking
- [x] Reading
- [x] Completing projects
- [x] Doing homework
- [x] Drawing
- [x] Watching YouTube videos
