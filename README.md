## **About 👦🏻** ##

🙋🏻‍♂️ Hello, coding world!

🏫 I go to Moody Middle School and I love to learn new things!

🏏Sometimes, I like to play cricket and soccer, except the COVID times where I just play Cricket 2011 (the EA game).

👨🏻‍💻 You can find me on [Repl.it (now Replit.com, I'll change that on Friday cuz that's when they're moving)](http://repl.it/@YashasShah) and [GitHub](http://github.com/ParrotCode101).
