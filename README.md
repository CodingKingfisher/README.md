### **About** ###

Hello, coding world...

I know 11 languages: HTML, Dart, Flutter, Python, JS, CSS, Python Turtle, JSON, Node.JS, & React.JS.
I go to Moody Middle School and I love to learn new things!
My favourite day of the year is 25th December. Why? It's my birthday.
Sometimes, I like to play cricket and soccer, except the COVID times where I just play Cricket 2011 (the EA game).
I love the colour eco-green. As you might know, Psittaciformes are a large intrest of mine.

You can find me on [Repl.it](http://repl.it/YashasShah) and [GitHub](http://github.com/ParrotCode101).

Some of my favourite hobbies (excluding coding) include:
- [x] Biking
- [x] Reading
- [x] Completing projects
- [x] Doing homework
- [x] Drawing
- [x] Watching YouTube videos
