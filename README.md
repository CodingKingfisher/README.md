### **About** ###

Hello, coding world...

I know 8 languages: HTML, Python, CSS, JS, Node.JS, Tcl, Haskell, & Dart.
I go to Moody Middle School and I love to learn new things!
My favourite day of the year is 25th December. Why? It's my birthday.
Sometimes, I like to play cricket and soccer, except the COVID times where I just play Cricket 2011 (the EA game).
I love the colour eco-green.

You can find me on [Repl.it](http://repl.it/YashasShah) and [GitHub](http://github.com/ParrotCode101).
