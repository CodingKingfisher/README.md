# ParrotCode101 #

Hey everyone! I am ParrotCode101; your friendly neighborhood Parrot that loves to code! I mostly code in HTML, CSS, & JS; though I  can code fairly well in Python, Python Turtle, Node.JS, JavaScript, and a bit of Ruby.

I love the colour eco-green. As you might know, Psittaciformes are a large intrest of mine. I really love to play sports like Cricket and Soccer.
